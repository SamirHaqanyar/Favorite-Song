        <h1>Sunflower by Post Malone & Swae Lee</h1>
        <p>
          "Sunflower" by Post Malone and Swae Lee is a Double Diamond hit with
          20 million copies sold. Produced in one session in 2018, its success
          was boosted by its inclusion in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The
          song's lyrics compare a person to a resilient sunflower, with Lee and
          Malone acknowledging their flaws. Its honest portrayal of human nature
          contributed to its popularity.

        <h2>About Sunflower by Post Malone and Swae Lee</h2>
        <p>
          "Sunflower" was released in October 2018, off the album "Hollywood's
          Bleeding" from Post Malone, which eventually went Double Diamond and
          sold 20 million copies. It was no surprise that it debuted at number
          one, as its success was already being driven by the movie "Spider-Man:
          Into the Spider-Verse," not to mention the popular melody and combined
          popularity of the two performers, Post Malone and Swae Lee.
